# The Stable Matching Problem

## From the book "Algorithms Design" by Kleinberg

The Stable Matching Problem originated, in part, in 1962,
when David Gale and Lloyd Shapley two mathematical economists,
asked the question: Could one design a college admissions process,
or a job recruiting process, that was self-enforcing?
What did they mean by this?
Following Gale and Shapley, we observe that this special case can
be viewed as the problem of devising a system by which each of n men
and n women can end up getting married: our problem naturally has the
analogue of two “genders”—the applicants and the companies—and in the
case we are considering, everyone is seeking to be paired with exactly
one individual of the opposite gender.
